TYPO3 offers locking methods are: simple (is_file method), flock (filesystem locking attributes) and semaphore (System V IPC Key). These three drivers are rewritten into an adaptive driver api to boost performance and abstraction. There is also a new driver for MySQL Locking through an InnoDB table called \'sys_lock\'.
